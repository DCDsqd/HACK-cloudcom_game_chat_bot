### Token format

Token example: 7231115870:AUUUpyd0KALSPD9K-VluXSv2JKjdlyt5F4w </br>
It should be inserted insted of the first line in ```*token*.txt``` file(s)

### Note:

If you have changed the token(s) and don't want to commit them in repo, the easy way to "untrack" them (not really but it works) is to just run:

```git update-index --assume-unchanged <token-file-path>```

See [git update-index](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-update-index.html) for further syntax help
