### Place ```laupdate.exe``` file with all its dependencies (***good luck***) here if you want to use ```run_lupdate_for_admin_tool_from_external_lupdate.sh``` script

### A much easier way is to use ```run_lupdate_for_admin_tool.sh``` (***[check this out](https://github.com/DCDsqd/HACK-cloudcom_game_chat_bot/blob/main/scripts/README.md)***)  script or just run lupdate from QtCreator
